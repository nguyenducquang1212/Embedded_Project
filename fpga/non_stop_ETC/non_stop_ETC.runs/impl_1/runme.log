WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net push_data_DUT/data_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin push_data_DUT/data_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell push_data_DUT/data_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
